# Who we are

Comet Robotics at UT Dallas is a student organization with the goal of promoting robotics at UT Dallas and in the surrounding area through outreach, projects and workshops. We compete with colleges and universities across the globe in combat robotics competitions, and programs like VEX U and University Rover Challenge.

With membership open to all students regardless of major or prior experience in robotics, we provide students with the opportunity to collaborate and compete with like-minded individuals to gain experience and refine their knowledge of designing, building, and programming robots. As an organization, we aim to build and sustain an engaged body of students hoping to expand upon their coursework and gain real-world experience, developing skills in project management, leadership, teamwork, and much more.

# History

Originally started with ‘The Blender’, our 120-pound, world-championship-winning BattleBot, combat robotics at UT Dallas has history going back to 2004. This club was founded in 2021 as a rebirth of the now-defunct UT Dallas Combat Robotics club, during which time we focused on antweight and beetleweight combat robots. Since then, we have expanded to dozens of 1lb, 3lb, and 12lb weight class combat robots, rebranding the org as Comet Robotics in summer 2023 to reflect our expanded focus with our competitive robotics division.

# Org Structure

Projects are the heart of Comet Robotics, and consist of teams that work together to develop their project, helping each other and learning new skills along the way. While each project is led by one Project Manager, a project may optionally have a number of Team Leads focused on specific goals or needs of their project, like a software lead.

Each project falls under one of 2 divisions, Combat Robotics and Competitive Robotics, both of which have directors overseeing the projects and helping to address their needs. Combat Robotics encompasses our combat robot projects, while Competitive Robotics holds all remaining projects which don't fall under the Combat Robotics roster.

The organization is led as a whole by the President, Vice President and other supporting officers, who work together to keep Comet Robotics moving and support the goals of the organization. Officers and project managers are elected positions with 1-year terms.

brainstorming 

who is this site for?
- students - whose goal is to learn about the club and decide whether to join. is it worth my time, will i fit in, etc.
- potential sponsors - see what we do and why to consider supporting the club

i think as long as we do a good job of tailoring copy to students we'll achieve the goal of communicating what we do to other stakeholders as well.

pages i like copy on
- https://www.nhrl.io/ 
  - does a good job of explaining what nhrl/combat is without taking themselves too seriously. we shouldn't come across as overly professional/business-like in our copy, because we aren't :)
- https://www.purduehackers.com/
  - like how the copy is addressing the viewer specifically. i'd also say purdue hackers has a similar goal to us in that we're both very project focused orgs and agree that building stuff outside of class is a very rewarding experience
- https://acm.cs.purdue.edu
  - does a good job of balancing a professional but semi informal tone. makes it easy to understand what exactly they do as an org and why you should join a SIG. org has a similar structure to us in that being in a SIG is how you are a part of the org
- https://hackclub.com/clubs/, https://hackclub.com/
  - explains clearly what a hack club is and what you do in a hack club.
