    backgroundPosition="40% 10%"
    divisionName="Combat Robotics"
    divisionDescription="We're all about sparks, fire and spilling robot guts. The excitement around the sport is perfect for spreading awareness of robotics. Our Combat Robotics division promises something for everyone, with entry-level programs and lots of upward mobility."
    divisionOverview="Ever wanted to build a battle bot, like the TV show? Combat Robotics is the place to be.\nOriginally started with ’The Blender‘, our 120lb world championship winning BattleBot, combat robotics at UT Dallas has history going back to 2004. Since the clubs’ revival in 2021, we have expanded to dozens of 1lb, 3lb, and 12lb weight class projects."

    divisionName="Competitive Robotics"
    divisionDescription="Hosting our non-combat robot projects (including COMET, our VEX U team, Solis Rover Project, our University Rover Challenge team, and the ChessBot project), the Competitive Robotics division challenges students in fast paced engineering environments and builds on the hard and soft skills learned in students coursework."
    divisionOverview="Projects in the Competitive Robotics division feature demanding mechanical requirements, and a heavy emphasis on software control systems to achieve their goals.\nWhether you're a FIRST or VEX alumni, or completely new to the world of competitive robotics, Comet Robotics has a place for you!"
