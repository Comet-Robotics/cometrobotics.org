# Our Mission
Comet Robotics, a student-led organization at the University of Texas at Dallas, is a group of students who are passionate about robotics and engineering. We design, build, and compete with robots in various competitions. Our goal is to provide students with the opportunity to learn and apply engineering concepts in a hands-on environment. We welcome students from all backgrounds and experience levels to join us in our mission to promote STEM education and robotics in our community.

<!--
Comet Robotics is a student-led organization at the University of Texas at
Dallas. This club was founded in 2021, as a rebirth of the now-defunct UT Dallas Combat Robotics club and rebranded to Comet Robotics in summer 2023 to represent our expanded focus to include our competitive robotics division.

Originally started with ‘The Blender’, our 120lb world championship winning BattleBot, combat robotics at UT Dallas has history going back to 2004. Since the clubs' revival in 2021, we have expanded to dozens of 1lb, 3lb, and 12lb weight class combat robots and grown to include more competitive robotics projects.

we are group of students who are passionate about all things robots, from software, to mechanical, and all the things in between . 

Computer science students, as well as engineering and non-STEM majors alike come together
united by our passion for all things robotics


Who we are
Comet Robotics at UT Dallas is a student organization with the goal of promoting robotics at UT Dallas and in the surrounding area through outreach, projects and workshops. We're building a world-class robotics program, competing with colleges and universities across the globe in combat robotics competitions, and programs like VEX U and University Rover Challenge.

With membership open to all students regardless of major or prior experience in robotics, we provide students with the opportunity to collaborate and compete with like-minded individuals to gain experience and refine their knowledge of designing, building, and programming robots. As an organization, we aim to build and sustain an engaged body of students hoping to expand upon their coursework and gain real-world experience, developing skills in project management, leadership, teamwork, and much more. 



Achievements
This academic year alone, we've achieved significant milestones as a club, including but not limited to:
building a bulletproof, 1000-pound, 8 ft x 8 ft x 8 ft battlebox for safely fighting combat robots up to 3lbs in mass
competing at 10 public combat robotics competitions with 6 podium finishes
being invited to and competing at an official BattleBots event at SXSW in March 2024 with a 15-pound combat robot
significant progress on prototyping/R&D for a Mars rover to compete in the University Rover Challenge
starting a VEX U competition team, which received an invitation to compete at the VEX Robotics World Championship in its first year based on performance
hosting 3 outreach events in collaboration with local schools, introducing over 150 middle and high schoolers to robotics and the engineering design process through our custom 3D-printed combat robotics kit, Combat Blocks -->
